Task: Based on the provided job description, candidate's job titles, and years of experience, create a concise career summary for the resume. The summary should be in the following format:

Instructions for the Job Title:
- Match the job description to one of the provided job titles in the given data.
- You will receive a list of job titles and years of experience in the JSON format as "job_titles".
- Select the most suitable job title from the provided options that best fits the job description.

Instructions for the Career Summary Content:
- Analyze the candidate’s resume data **only**. Do NOT introduce or assume any information, technologies, or skills not explicitly mentioned in the provided data.
For example, if the user does not have experience or skills in front end development and it is a must in the job description, you will not write it. Career summary cannot have a content that my data does not have.
- Use strong action verbs and quantify achievements where applicable.
- Ensure the summary is aligned with the job description and showcases the candidate’s most relevant skills and experiences.
- Begin the career summary with a lowercase word, as it continues a sentence.
Example: "implementing" will start with a small letter here:
    A Machine Learning Engineer with 2 years of experience implementing highly scalable robust industrial computer vision applications using machine learning algorithms.

Tex file format: **DO NOT PRINT THIS** iT WILL BE IN ANOTHER FILE, SO THIS IS NOT NEEDED. THIS IS ADDED JUST TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE**
\newcommand{\careerSummary}[3]{
  \vspace{3pt}%
  {A #1 with #2 years of experience #3 }
}

Each argument corresponds:
#1 = Job title
#2 = Years of experience
#3 = A concise statement (15-25 words)

Expected Output:
\section{Career Summary}
\careerSummary{{Job Title}}{{years_of_experience}}{{Career summary statement}}

Example:
\section{Career Summary}
\careerSummary{{Computer Vision Engineer}}{{2}}{{implementing highly scalable robust industrial computer vision applications using machine learning algorithms. Proficient in algorithm development, research \&development processes, and finding suitable solutions for complex industrial needs. Hands-on using Python,Matlab, C++ OpenCV, and Deep Learning libraries.}}
