Task: Based on the provided job description, candidate's job titles, and years of experience, create a concise career summary for the resume. The summary should be in the following format:

Instructions:
- The career summary must not exceed 3 lines in total, font size is 11pt.
- Use strong action verbs and quantify achievements where possible.
- Ensure that the content is tailored to the job description and showcases the candidate's most relevant strengths.
- Choose the most suitable job title in the Job Titles for the job description.
- Use ONLY the data provided. Do not add, invent, or assume any details not explicitly given.
- Career summary has to start with a small letter since it is the continuation of the sentence.
Example: "implementing" will start with small letter here:
    A Machine Learning Engineer with 2 years of experience implementing highly scalable robust industrial computer vision applications using machine learning algorithms.


Tex file format: **DO NOT PRINT THIS** iT WILL BE IN ANOTHER FILE, SO THIS IS NOT NEEDED. THIS IS ADDED JUST TO HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE
\newcommand{\careerSummary}[3]{
  \vspace{3pt}%
  {A #1 with #2 years of experience #3 }
}

Data:
Job Titles: {{job_titles}}
Years of Experience: {{years_of_experience}}

Each argument corresponds:
#1 = The most relevant job title from the data.
#2 = Years of experience from the data.
#3 = A concise statement (15-25 words) highlighting the candidate's most relevant qualifications, experiences, and skills that align with the job requirements for the job description in a natural huma-like sounding way.

Example:
\section{Career Summary}
\careerSummary{{Computer Vision Engineer}}{{2}}{{implementing highly scalable robust industrial computer vision applications using machine learning algorithms. Proficient in algorithm development, research \&development processes, and finding suitable solutions for complex industrial needs. Hands-on using Python,Matlab, C++ OpenCV, and Deep Learning libraries.}}
