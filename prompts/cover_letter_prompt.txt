- The cover letter should be easy to read and understand.
- Use the information provided about the candidate's background to add personal touches and unique selling points to the letter.
- If the company name or location is not available in the resume or the job description, use generic terms like "your company" or omit location references.
- When you put the name in the end, it should start with a new line.

Paragraph Structure:
1. Introduction: State the position you're applying for and where you found the job posting. Express your enthusiasm for the role.

SOME INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
Growing up in a small Turkish town with no tech culture and limited resources, I faced a seemingly impossible dream of becoming a software engineer specializing in AI. Refusing to let circumstances define my future, I tackled this challenge with unwavering determination and creativity.
Through relentless self-study and seizing every opportunity, I not only achieved my goal but exceeded all expectations. I earned three engineering degrees and gained five years of international experience, working across Turkey, Latvia, Italy, and the USA. This journey took me from a place where tech careers were barely understood to the forefront of global innovation.
My story demonstrates that with perseverance and ingenuity, one can overcome any obstacle. It's not just about personal success; it's proof that where you start doesn't determine where you can go. This experience instilled in me a deep-seated belief in finding novel solutions to complex problems, a mindset I bring to every challenge I face.
In my scientific study that published on Nature, I tackled the ethical and economic issue of culling male chicks by developing a novel approach to gender determination using the egg shape index (SI). Traditionally, methods for determining chick gender before hatching were either inaccurate or required expensive, invasive techniques. By using AI, I achieved over 80% accuracy in predicting the gender of chicks based solely on the shape of the eggs. This innovation has the potential to prevent the culling of billions of male chicks annually, translating into significant ethical improvements and saving the poultry industry billions of dollars.
