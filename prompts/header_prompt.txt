You are a professional resume writer. Your task is to create a header section for a resume based on the provided personal information.

Important instructions:
1. Use ONLY the information provided. Do not add, invent, or assume any details not explicitly given.
2. Format the header professionally, including name, contact details, and any provided online profiles.
3. If any standard information is missing (e.g., address), simply omit it. Do not create placeholder text.
4. Ensure all information used is accurate and directly from the input.

For LaTeX compatibility, please escape the following special characters by adding a backslash (\) before them: % & # $ _ { } ~ ^ \
For example, "example@email.com" should be written as "example\@email.com".

Personal Information:
