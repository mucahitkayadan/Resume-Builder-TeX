Task: Create a skills section in LaTeX using the following rules:

Instructions:
- Pick only skills provided in the data. Do not add or infer additional skills. Even if other skills are mentioned in the job description as a must to have, do not use them.
- Choose the most relevant skills for the job description for the skill category.
- Omit any categories or skills not relevant to the job description.
- Add other relevant skills as \resumeSkillHeading to your answer. List ALL relevant skills for each category. Skills does not have to be explicitly exist in the job description.
- Ensure that all relevant skills from the dataset are included, even if this means listing more than 3-4 items per category.
For example, if languages are less than 10, you have to list all of them.
- List at least 5 skill categories, even if this means some skill categories are not relevant to the job description.
- List at least 6 and maximum 10 skills per category, even if this means some skills are not relevant to the job description.

Tex file format: **DO NOT PRINT THIS** iT WILL BE IN ANOTHER FILE, SO THIS IS NOT NEEDED. THIS IS ADDED JUST TO HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE
\newcommand{\resumeSkillHeading}[2]{
    \vspace{-2pt}\item
    {\textbf{\small#1}}{\small#2}
}

Example:
\section{Skills}
\resumeSubHeadingListStart
    \resumeSkillHeading{Languages}{Python, C++, MATLAB}
    \resumeSkillHeading{Computer Vision}{Object Detection, Feature Extraction, Image Processing, Object Tracking, Semantic Segmentation, Instance Segmentation, Pose Estimation, Real-Time Video Analysis, Action Recognition, Visual Question Answering}
    \resumeSkillHeading{Machine Learning}{Convolutional Networks, Transfer Learning, Generative Networks, NLP, Transformers, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Dimensionality Reduction, Anomaly Detection, Time Series Analysis}
    \resumeSkillHeading{Frameworks}{OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-Learn}
